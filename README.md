# Paragraph Summarizer with Huggingface
Transformer models can be used to condense long documents into summaries, a task known as text summarization. This is one of the most challenging NLP tasks as it requires a range of abilities, such as understanding long passages and generating coherent text that captures the main topics in a document. However, when done well, text summarization is a powerful tool that can speed up various business processes by relieving the burden of domain experts to read long documents in detail.
